# 2D Java Sandbox Game 

---

## Description
A top-down, tile-based sandbox game inspired by Minecraft, written in Java. Originally developed at age 13, the project showcases early use of Perlin noise for procedural world generation and basic physics/math for tile interaction.

## Features

* Randomized world generation using Perlin noise
* Tile-based interaction and collision
* Rudimentary sandbox mechanics
* Basic game physics and distance-based constraints

## Controls

* `WASD`: Move character
* `Space`: Punch
* `F`: Open/close doors
* `Right Mouse Button`: Break tile
* `Left Mouse Button`: Place tile
* `Z`: Toggle between wall/floor tile types

## Development Notes

* Codebase contains legacy logic and non-modular design due to the project's early inception.
* Actively working on an updated, refactored version.
