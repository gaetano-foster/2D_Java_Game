## Description

It's 2D Minecraft from a bird's-eye view, essentially.
It's more a sandbox than anything. I wrote it when I was 13 and never gave it a real name, but I still think it's a nice demonstration of my ability. 
It uses some algebra to determine things like if you can place a tile within a certain distance, and a perlin noise library for world generation.
I know the code is sloppy and ugly and hacky, but please keep in mind I was about 13 when I began this project, and I was completely self taught.
I've been working on an update for it, so there will be a better version in the future.
